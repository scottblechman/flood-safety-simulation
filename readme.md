# Texas Tech University Flash Flood Simulation

## Scott Blechman and Fox Bolduc

## CS 4331 - Project 2

### Purpose
Using Apple's ARKit, we aim to create an app that will place players in the middle of a flash flood. Their objective, will be to reach a spot safe from the flood waters while avoiding the dangers of a flash flood such as deep and rapidly moving water. Players will be scored based on their ability to reach safety while avoiding these hazards.

### Tools Used

#### Apple ARKit
(Scott, you can explain how this is used a bit more)

#### National Elevation Dataset
All elevation data used in the creation of this app was taken from the National Elevation Dataset (available [here](https://viewer.nationalmap.gov/basic/?basemap=b1&category=ned,nedsrc&title=3DEP%20View)).

We used the most accurate data available in the Lubbock area, 1/3 arc-second, which provides us an elevation resolution of approximately 10 meters.

#### Python (subject to change)
All data analysis of elevation data and flooding simulation was done using Python.

### Creating the Elevation Model
